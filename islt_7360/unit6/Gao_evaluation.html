    <h1>Evaluation Report of Yixiang Gao's Pilot Website</h1>

    <h2>Evaluator Participants</h2>
    <h3>Participant 1</h3>
    <p>Jacob is a personal friend of mine. He started in Mizzou as a journalism major but ended up graduating with a bachelor degree in information and technology. He currently works at the division of IT full-time. Whenever we hang out with each other, we would share a lot of our opinions about programming, hardware & software, technologies in general. Although he is not in the academic field, he definitely has a huge passion for the topics of my site. He was using <b>macOS Mojave 10.14.3</b> with <b>Google Chrome 72.0</b>.</p>

    <h3>Participant 2</h3>
    <p>Tushar is a Ph.D. student who works in the same laboratory as me. He has a lot more experience in the academic field than me. He also read articles from many other sources that share similar topics as my website. He was using <b>Ubuntu 16.04</b> with <b>Firefox Quantum 65</b>.</p>

    <h3>Participant 3</h3>
    <p>Ali is also a Ph.D. student who works in the same laboratory. Like Tushar, all three of us share similar interests in our research topics as well as the needs in using website resources to gather information for our research and projects in general. He was using <b>a laptop running Linux</b> and <b>Firefox</b>.</p>

    <h2>Summary of Evaluator's Comments</h2>
    <h3>Participant 1</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The eavluator mentioned that there is no explainations on the graphs used on home page or the site logo. The evaluator also pointed out that the mailto link is small and inconspicuous in the footer.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Participant 2</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The evaluator addressed some concern for the "tutorial" page. When the volumn of information goes up, the navigation won't be easy. He suggested to create a drop-down menu to give access to all the links. The evaluator also had hard time finding the contact email from the website.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Participant 3</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The evaluator suggested that all images in "About Me" page could be better if they fit the page. The evaluator also expressed some concern that the contact, specifically the email, is not easily accessible.</p>

    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <p>Based on my evaluators’ feedback, I think the main purpose for this website, which is to share ideas and experiences in the scientific and technical field that I am working under, was achieved. All three evaluators are giving positive feedbacks on grasping the main idea for my website. Although, one potential problem was raised that the images used in my “Home Page” are not very self-explanatory and could be improved to connect better with the content that I am creating. One major feedback across all three evaluators was that the email/contact information is not very obvious to find on my website. From my users perspective, they might have questions regarding the content that I shared and would like to ask me those questions. So it is important that they can find the contact information easily.</p>

    <h2>Recommended/Planned changes to the design</h2>
    <p>One major change that I would add is to make sure that my contact information is at somewhere that’s obvious and easy to access. All three of my evaluators have addresses that they have a hard time finding the email information at the footer of my website or could not even find it. Potentially, I will add a comment/reply section at the end of each content page I create. These changes can help promote communication between me and my users.</p>

    <h2>Reflection on my evaluation</h2>
    <p>I think a lot of times during the design process, I can be focused too much into the details of my website and forget what is the big picture or the main idea behind creating this website at the first place. Have different people to evaluate my website can not only help me recognize some of the major issues that my website has but also very useful in identifying some other design aspect that I might not be able to notice.</p>
    <p>Take one of my use cases as an example, people come to my website to obtain information or experiences that I shared in order to assist what they are working with. Often times, they probably could not directly apply without modifications. Thus, it is important that they can ask me questions to clarify some of their concerns. I wanted to promote this sort of communication in my website at the first place but as I focus on the layout and other stuff of the site, I forgot to make sure that the communication information is easily accessible.</p>
