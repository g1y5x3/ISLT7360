    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Yixiang Gao. I am at my 3rd year as a PhD student majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Missouri - Columbia. I work as a research assistant at the <a href="http://vigir.missouri.edu/">Vision-Guided Intelligent Robotics Laboratory</a>.</p>
    <p>I am passionate in the field of robotics, computer vision, and machine learning in general, though I am still trying to define exactly what my PhD thesis is going to be. (Oops!) However, the subject that fascinates me the most are probably studies/topics which involve machine and human interactions. I believe this is an area that can (or already have) tremendously impact peopleâ€™s lives on a practical level. As someone who studies and develops these mathematical and computational mechanisms, I feel privileged but also responsible for the models I build.</p>
    <p>Two things that I have learned so far during my journey as a research assistant and a computer engineer: 1) it is almost impossible to find the exact article or support materials that fit exactly to the project that I am working on. 2) sometimes it is very hard to find a good tutorials that can help me understand the topic intuitively.</p>
    <p>Thus, the purpose for this website is to first, share with everyone some of cool projects (at least I consider) that I had done and how I did them. I would love to share those experiences that I have in using a particular toolbox, different libraries, or applications that I hope can help other engineers or developers. Second, after several years of studying in this field, I have also built some intuitions on certain topics that I am most familiar with. So I would love to share those knowledge to hopefully assist others who are also interested in those subjects I study.</p>
    <p>Finally, thank you for visiting my website!</p>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
